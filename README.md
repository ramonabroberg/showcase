# SHOWCASE

The Showcase website is a page for music enthusiasts who easily want to find concerts and other evets and who wish that everything was gathered in one place instead of having to look around on several different pages to find their tickets.

Users will find all the information they need on the website. All upcoming gigs are displayed with information about the band/artist, date, time, place and ticket price. When the users have found a ticket they wish to buy, they're easily linked to the page that sells the ticket.

The website also has information about Showcase and the vision behind it all. Users also have the option to sign up for a newsletter so they will be first to receive information about new events.
