# SHOWCASE

---

The Showcase website is a page for music enthusiasts who want to find concerts and other evets and who wish that everything was gathered in one place instead of having to look around on several different pages to find their tickets.

Users will find all the information they need on the website. All upcoming gigs are displayed with information about the band/artist, date, time, place and ticket price. When you have found the ticket you wish to buy, you're easily linked to the page that sells the ticket.

The website also has information about who Showcase is and the vision behind it all. Users also have the option to sign up for the newsletter so they will be first to receive information about new events.
